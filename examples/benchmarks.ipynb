The presence of RNA processing proteins and stress response regulators suggests a complex regulatory network governing gene expression and cellular adaptation.                 Transcriptional regulation via MYC/MAX network                                                                                                     This cluster shows a strong signature of transcriptional regulation centered around the MYC/MAX network. MYC and MAX form a well-established heterodimer that regulates transcription of growth-related genes. The cluster includes several established transcription factors (GABPA, GABPB1, SP2) and chromatin regulators (SETD2, ZMYND8) that likely cooperate in MYC-dependent transcriptional programs. RNA-binding proteins (ILF3, HNRNPM) suggest coordination between transcription and RNA processing. Several genes with established roles in other pathways (KEAP1, DDA1, SPAG5) may represent novel connections to MYC-mediated transcription, particularly through protein degradation, oxidative stress response, and cell cycle regulation. The presence of metabolic regulators (SLC38A2) aligns with MYC's known role in metabolic reprogramming. This cluster reveals potential new regulatory mechanisms in the MYC transcriptional network.                                 Mitotic Cell Cycle Progression and Chromosome Segregation                                                                                                                                                                                   Cluster 121 is enriched for genes involved in Mitotic Cell Cycle Progression and Chromosome Segregation (Medium Confidence). Key established members include components of the mitotic spindle (SPAG5), cytokinesis (RAB11FIP4), cell cycle regulators (FAM32A), epigenetic modifiers (SETD2, N6AMT1), RNA processing factors (SON), and transcription factors (MYC, MAX, GABPA, GABPB1) that regulate cell cycle and growth. Several genes with functions in other pathways, such as E3 ligase component DDA1, microtubule regulator MEMO1, and chromatin reader ZMYND8, are identified as high-priority candidates for novel roles in this pathway, suggesting potential uncharacterized mechanisms regulating mitosis or chromosome segregation.                                Transcriptional Regulation and Chromatin Modification                                                                                                              Cluster 121 exhibits a High Confidence signature for 'Transcriptional Regulation and Chromatin Modification'. It contains numerous established transcription factors (MYC, MAX, GABPA, GABPB1, SP2, FOXN1, POU5F1B), chromatin modifiers/readers (SETD2, N6AMT1, ZMYND8), RNA processing factors (SON, ILF3, HNRNPM), and regulators of protein stability impacting transcription (KEAP1, DDA1), accounting for ~68% of the genes. No genes meet the criteria for UNCHARACTERIZED. Several genes with established roles in other processes (e.g., ZBTB11 - likely TF but poorly studied, RAB11FIP4 - trafficking, SPAG5 - mitosis, MEMO1 - migration, CCDC174 - neuronal dev?, FAM32A - apoptosis, SLC38A2 - transport) are flagged as potential NOVEL_ROLE candidates, suggesting potential crosstalk between transcription/chromatin regulation and other cellular processes like signaling, transport, metabolism, and cell cycle/cytoskeleton dynamics.                                                                         MYC-MAX transcriptional signaling network and chromatin regulation                                           Cluster 121 is highly enriched for genes with well-established roles in the MYC-MAX transcriptional network, including canonical transcriptional activators/repressors (MYC, MAX, GABPA/B1, SP2) and a major histone methyltransferase (SETD2) central to chromatin states influencing transcription. Additional genes in the cluster (e.g., SON, ILF3, HNRNPM, ZMYND8) further reinforce a theme of extended chromatin and RNA processing regulation, which converges on the control of gene expression and cell proliferation. CCDC174 and POU5F1B rank as the strongest uncharacterized candidates, having minimal published function. FAM32A and ZBTB11 have plausible but previously unrecognized links to this pathway, meriting further study. The overall clustering points to strong functional coherence centered on transcriptional and chromatin regulation programs.  Transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification                                                                                      Cluster 121 is highly confidently associated with transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification due to the presence of well-established pathway members such as MYC, MAX, SETD2, and members of the GABP transcription factor complex. The novel role for SP2 in this pathway is plausible due to its known DNA binding properties, suggesting its potential underexplored influence in transcriptional regulation. ZBTB11 is identified as uncharacterized, offering significant potential for novel functional discoveries in transcriptional and chromatin modification contexts.                                           Transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modification                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Cluster 121 demonstrates a dominant signal centered on transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modification. Established genes such as MYC, MAX, GABPA, SP2, GABPB1, SETD2, N6AMT1, SON, HNRNPM, and ZMYND8 provide a robust foundation for a transcription–chromatin network. In addition, several genes with well‐characterized roles in other processes (e.g., oxidative stress, cell migration, cytokinesis, and metabolism) emerge as potential novel contributors to this regulatory axis. These novel role candidates warrant further investigation to elucidate potential cross‐talk between classical transcriptional pathways and other cellular processes in interphase HeLa cells.                                      H3K36me3-mediated coupling of transcriptional elongation with co-transcriptional RNA splicing                                                                                                                                                                                                              Cluster 121 groups multiple chromatin writers/readers (SETD2, ZMYND8), splicing cofactors (SON, ILF3, HNRNPM), and general transcription regulators, pointing to a specific mechanism of H3K36me3-mediated coupling between elongation and pre-mRNA processing. High-priority follow-ups include poorly characterized zinc-finger/coactivator genes (ZBTB11, CCDC174, POU5F1B) and known methyltransferases or TFs (N6AMT1, MYC, GABPA) for potential new roles in this pathway.\n",

The presence of assembly factors like DMAC1 and multiple respiratory chain complex subunits suggests a focused biological process centered on mitochondrial electron transport chain formation and maintenance.  Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly and function                                                                     Cluster 149 shows a strong signature of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly and function, with 7 established genes directly involved in respiratory complexes I, III, and V. The cluster contains components of Complex I (NDUFV2, NDUFA6, NDUFC1, DMAC1), Complex III (CYC1, UQCRFS1), and Complex V (ATP5ME). Two mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPL57, MRPL55) are uncharacterized with potential specialized roles in translating respiratory chain components. Several genes with established functions in other pathways (KRAS, BRAF, RAD23B, LRPPRC, MRPL18, GATC) may have novel roles in regulating mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly or function, potentially linking signaling pathways, protein quality control, and mitochondrial translation to respiratory chain biogenesis. The highest priority candidates for follow-up are KRAS and BRAF, which could represent novel regulatory connections between oncogenic signaling and mitochondrial function.  Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain / Oxidative Phosphorylation and related processes                                                                                                                 Cluster 149 is strongly enriched for genes involved in the mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS), including components of Complexes I, III, and V, as well as factors required for complex assembly, mitochondrial translation (ribosomal proteins, tRNA synthesis, rRNA import), and mitochondrial potential. This pathway is assigned High Confidence, explaining 12 out of 19 genes. No genes were found to be uncharacterized based on available information. Several genes with established roles in other pathways (signaling, protein degradation, cytoskeleton, transcription) are present and classified as Novel Role candidates with varying priority for follow-up, based on the plausibility of their involvement in mitochondrial function or regulation.                                      Mitochondrial Respiration and Protein Synthesis  Cluster 149 exhibits a strong signature for 'Mitochondrial Respiration and Protein Synthesis' (High confidence), encompassing 12 established genes involved in electron transport chain complexes (I, III, V), complex assembly (DMAC1), mitochondrial ribosome components (MRPLs), tRNA modification (GATC), and mitochondrial RNA metabolism (LRPPRC). No genes meet the criteria for 'UNCHARACTERIZED'. Seven genes are classified as 'NOVEL_ROLE', potentially linking other cellular processes to mitochondrial state. NINL (microtubule organization) has the highest priority (6) for investigation due to plausible links to mitochondrial dynamics. RAD23B (ubiquitin receptor) and UBAC2 (ER function) have moderate priority (5), suggesting potential roles in mitochondrial quality control or ER-mitochondria contacts, respectively. KRAS/BRAF (MAPK signaling) have lower priority (4) as their metabolic links are known, while SNAPC1 and LSM11 (nuclear transcription/RNA processing) have minimal priority (1) due to lack of plausible connection.                                                                       Mitochondrial electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation                                                                                                                                           This gene cluster shows a high-confidence enrichment for mitochondrial electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, as evidenced by numerous canonical genes for complexes I, III, and V (NDUFV2, NDUFA6, NDUFC1, DMAC1, CYC1, UQCRFS1, ATP5ME, LRPPRC, GATC). Two genes, MRPL55 and MRPL57, remain essentially uncharacterized and are high-priority targets for novel discovery in the context of mitochondrial function. UBAC2 and NINL have plausible but unestablished connections to this pathway and represent interesting leads for possible noncanonical roles in mitochondrial biology. The rest of the cluster contains genes with functions in RNA processing, cell signaling, or the proteasome, which are less directly related to the dominant process.                        Mitochondrial respiratory chain                                                                                                           The gene cluster 149 suggests a medium confidence pathway association with the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Established genes predominantly belong to the mitochondrial complexes I and III, pointing to a concerted function in electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Two genes, MRPL57 and MRPL55, lack detailed functional annotation, highlighting them as potential novel contributors to this pathway. Additionally, LRPPRC and DMAC1, despite having other established roles, may have previously underexplored connections within this pathway.                   Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and respiratory chain complex assembly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cluster 149 displays a strong and coherent mitochondrial signature, with a majority of genes representing well-established components of the electron transport chain, its assembly (Complex I and III) and associated mitochondrial translation and tRNA charging functions. In contrast, a minority of genes (e.g., KRAS, BRAF, RAD23B, SNAPC1, NINL, LSM11, UBAC2) traditionally linked to other signaling or nuclear pathways emerge as potential novel contributors. Their co-clustering with mitochondrial machinery suggests promising avenues for further investigation into previously unappreciated mitochondrial roles.                                                      Mitochondrial electron transport chain assembly and oxidative phosphorylation                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Cluster 149 is dominated by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, with core Complex I, III and V subunits, assembly factors, and mitoribosomal components. Two poorly annotated mitoribosomal proteins (MRPL57, MRPL55) emerge as high‐priority candidates for functional study. Several well‐characterized non‐mitochondrial genes (KRAS, BRAF, RAD23B, SNAPC1, NINL, LSM11, UBAC2) may have unrecognized roles in modulating mitochondrial function or OXPHOS assembly.\n",

AKIRIN2 emerges as a particularly interesting gene with a potential novel regulatory role in proteasome nuclear import.                               Proteasome assembly and function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Cluster 167 shows a highly coherent biological signature centered on proteasome assembly and function. It contains 14 established proteasome genes, including all core components of the 20S proteasome complex (alpha and beta subunits) and POMP, a dedicated proteasome assembly chaperone. Two genes represent potential novel connections: AKIRIN2, recently discovered to function in nuclear proteasome import, and UBE2R2, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that may have undiscovered direct interactions with the proteasome beyond its established role in creating ubiquitinated substrates. The clustering of these genes suggests that proteasome localization and substrate delivery mechanisms may be functionally linked to core proteasome activity.                                                           Proteasomal protein degradation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Cluster 167 is highly enriched for genes involved in proteasomal protein degradation. The majority of genes are core components of the 20S proteasome (PSMA and PSMB subunits). POMP is an essential chaperone for proteasome assembly. AKIRIN2 is involved in nuclear import of proteasomes. UBE2R2 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome. All genes have established roles within the ubiquitin-proteasome system or directly related processes essential for proteasomal degradation, resulting in a high confidence pathway assignment with all genes classified as ESTABLISHED members.                                                     Proteasome assembly and function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Cluster 167 shows exceptionally high confidence for the 'Proteasome assembly and function' pathway. It comprises 13 core subunits of the 20S proteasome (PSMA1-7, PSMB1-4, PSMB6-7), the essential proteasome assembly chaperone POMP, and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2R2, which acts upstream in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These 15 genes are classified as established members or functionally integral components. AKIRIN2, known for proteasome nuclear import and roles in other pathways like immunity, is flagged as potentially having a novel role or context-specific importance, meriting moderate priority for investigation based on its specific clustering with the core machinery in this phenotypic screen.  20S and 26S proteasome-mediated protein degradation (ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteolysis, core particle assembly and import)                                              Cluster 167 is dominated by well-established structural subunits and assembly factors of the 20S core and 26S proteasome, indicating a strong signature for ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteolysis, assembly, and function of the proteasome complex. AKIRIN2, while validated as a mediator of nuclear proteasome import, is less established as a canonical core component and may have regulatory roles worth deeper exploration in this context. UBE2R2, as a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, connects upstream ubiquitin signaling to substrate selection for degradation, but its specific contributions and regulatory interactions in relation to proteasomal core activity remain less characterized, especially in the context of the observed phenotypic screen. No cluster members are uncharacterized, as all possess substantial functional information.                Proteasome-mediated protein degradation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Cluster 167 is dominated by genes involved in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, a critical cellular process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis. Most genes are components of the 20S core proteasome complex, thus establishing a high-confidence pathway. AKIRIN2 and UBE2R2 present novel roles within this pathway—AKIRIN2 for its nuclear proteasome import role and UBE2R2 for its ubiquitin-conjugating function.              Proteasome assembly and proteolytic degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Cluster 167 is dominated by genes encoding the 20S proteasome core subunits and associated assembly factors, clearly indicating a role in proteasome-mediated protein degradation. All of these subunits along with AKIRIN2, which mediates proteasome nuclear import, are well established in this pathway. UBE2R2, despite its well-known function in ubiquitin conjugation, emerges as a candidate for a novel regulatory connection to proteasome function.                                                 20S proteasome core assembly and ubiquitin-proteasome–mediated protein degradation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Cluster 167 is dominated by nearly all 20S proteasome core α/β subunits and the maturation chaperone POMP, together with the proteasome nuclear import adaptor AKIRIN2 and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2R2. This coherent signature points with high confidence to proteasome assembly, nuclear targeting, and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation as the driving biology of this cluster.\n",

The cluster suggests complex interplay between RNA modification, chromatin organization, and post-translational protein modifications, with several genes presenting promising avenues for further investigation into novel regulatory mechanisms.                                RNA modification and processing                                                                                                This cluster reveals a medium-confidence RNA modification and processing pathway, anchored by the established m6A methyltransferase complex components METTL3 and METTL14, along with the RNA-binding protein HNRNPD. The presence of genes involved in diverse cellular processes suggests potential cross-talk between RNA modification and other pathways. UFL1 emerges as a high-priority candidate for investigation due to its established role in ribosome function and potential novel connection to RNA modification. VRK1's involvement in Cajal bodies (RNA processing centers) further supports the RNA processing theme. The cluster also contains minimally characterized genes like FITM1 and PTCHD4 that warrant investigation for potential roles in RNA metabolism. MCM3 and NCAPD3, while not classified as established pathway members, have functions in DNA replication and chromosome condensation that may indirectly affect RNA processing.                                            Cell Cycle Progression and Chromosome Dynamics  Cluster 197 shows a medium confidence enrichment for genes involved in Cell Cycle Progression and Chromosome Dynamics. Established members include SPAST (cytokinesis), NCAPD3 (mitotic chromosome structure), MCM3 (DNA replication), and VRK1 (cell cycle regulation, DNA damage, chromatin). Several genes with established roles in other pathways are also present, suggesting potential novel roles within this context. High-priority candidates for novel roles include FITM1 (lipid metabolism) and PTCHD4 (Hedgehog signaling), whose presence suggests potentially surprising and impactful connections to cell cycle and chromosome dynamics. Other novel role candidates (NCOR2, HNRNPD, METTL14, METTL3, UFL1) have more plausible or partially established links via transcriptional/RNA regulation or DNA damage response, but their specific contributions to the observed phenotype warrant further investigation.                         Regulation of Cell Cycle Progression and Chromosome Dynamics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Cluster 197 shows a high confidence signature for 'Regulation of Cell Cycle Progression and Chromosome Dynamics'. Established members include MCM3 (replication), NCAPD3 (chromosome condensation), VRK1 (cell cycle kinase), and SPAST (cytokinesis/NE assembly). PTCHD4 is classified as UNCHARACTERIZED due to minimal functional data. Several genes (FITM1, NCOR2, HNRNPD, METTL3, METTL14, UFL1) are classified as potentially having NOVEL_ROLEs, suggesting links between lipid metabolism (FITM1), transcription (NCOR2), RNA processing (HNRNPD, METTL3/14), and ufmylation/DDR (UFL1) with the core cell cycle and chromosome maintenance machinery represented by the established genes. FITM1 and PTCHD4 represent the highest priorities for uncovering potentially novel biology.                                                                                    Chromosome segregation and mitotic chromatin regulation  Cluster 197 is coherently enriched for genes involved in mitosis, particularly the regulation of chromosomal structure and segregation, including NCAPD3 (condensin-2 complex), MCM3 (DNA replication licensing), SPAST (microtubule severing in mitosis), and VRK1 (chromatin kinase). Several additional genes (METTL3, METTL14, HNRNPD, UFL1) have known functions in RNA modification, mRNA metabolism, or protein modification, with emerging or plausible but as-yet unconfirmed roles in chromatin and mitotic regulation. PTCHD4 stands out as the most uncharacterized gene relative to this pathway, presenting an opportunity for novel discovery if it is functionally linked to chromosome segregation phenotypes observed in the OPS screen. Other cluster members such as FITM1 and NCOR2 are likely unrelated to the dominant pathway, potentially reflecting secondary clustering or pleiotropic effects.      Chromosome condensation and cell cycle regulation                                                                                                                                                 Cluster 197 is characterized by genes involved in chromosome condensation and cell cycle regulation, suggesting a medium-confidence grouping around these processes. Established genes like NCAPD3 and VRK1, with clearly documented roles in these pathways, support this hypothesis. Additional genes, such as PTCHD4 and FITM1, are largely uncharacterized regarding this specific pathway, and novel roles are considered plausible but not strongly evidence-backed for genes like HNRNPD, MCM3, METTL14, METTL3, and UFL1.  Mitotic cell division focusing on cytokinesis, spindle disassembly, and chromosome condensation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Cluster 197 displays a coherent signature centered on mitotic cell division, particularly involving cytokinesis, spindle disassembly, and chromosome condensation. Established genes like SPAST, NCAPD3, MCM3, and VRK1 define the core mitotic machinery. Additional genes, although well characterized in other contexts (e.g., transcription regulation, mRNA methylation, hedgehog signaling, ufmylation, and lipid droplet formation), are flagged as potential novel regulators of mitosis. Their investigation may uncover new regulatory layers in the control of cell division in interphase HeLa cells.                                                                                    Mitotic chromosome condensation and cytokinesis                                                                                    Cluster 197 shows a loose enrichment for genes controlling mitotic chromosome condensation (NCAPD3) and cytokinesis (SPAST, VRK1). However, only 3/11 genes fit this theme directly, yielding low pathway confidence. The remainder are well characterized in other processes (RNA methylation, transcriptional repression, replication, lipid storage, hedgehog signaling, ufmylation) and represent candidates for novel roles in mitosis—particularly METTL3/METTL14 (m6A writers) and UFL1 (ufmylation of chromatin proteins), which may impact mitotic transcript regulation or chromatin compaction.\n",

The majority of genes are directly involved in nucleolar RNA modification, rRNA processing, and ribosomal subunit maturation. The cluster demonstrates a strong, literature-supported biological theme with multiple established pathway members.                    Ribosome biogenesis and pre-rRNA processing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Cluster 21 shows a strong signature of ribosome biogenesis and pre-rRNA processing, with 17 established genes directly involved in this pathway. Many genes are components of the small subunit (SSU) processome, which is critical for 18S rRNA maturation and 40S ribosomal subunit assembly. The cluster also includes translation initiation factors (EIF3 complex members) that function downstream in the same pathway. Three uncharacterized genes (NOC4L, NOL10, RRP12) likely function in ribosome biogenesis based on their names and limited annotation. Three genes with established roles in other pathways (DDX18, NEPRO, INO80) may have novel connections to ribosome biogenesis, potentially linking this process to R-loop regulation, developmental signaling, and chromatin remodeling, respectively.                   Ribosomal RNA processing, ribosome assembly, and translation initiation                                    Cluster 21 is highly enriched for genes involved in Ribosomal RNA processing, ribosome assembly, and translation initiation, indicating this is the dominant biological pathway. A large proportion of the genes (25/39) are established members of these interconnected processes, supporting a high confidence pathway assignment. Three genes (RRP12, NOC4L, NOL10) have minimal to no published functional information and are flagged as high-priority uncharacterized candidates. Several genes with known roles in other pathways, such as DYRK1A (kinase, cell cycle), DDX18 (RNA helicase, R-loops, rDNA), and INO80 (chromatin remodeling, mitosis), are identified as potential novel members with plausible roles in regulating or linking the dominant pathway to other cellular processes, with DDX18 having a particularly strong rationale due to its known function at rDNA loci.                     Ribosome biogenesis (40S subunit maturation and rRNA processing)                                                                                                                                                                                             Cluster 21 exhibits a high-confidence signature for ribosome biogenesis, specifically 40S subunit maturation and rRNA processing. Approximately 64% (25/39) of the genes are established components or direct regulators of this process or closely related functions like translation initiation involving the 40S subunit. Five genes (ABT1, ESF1, NEPRO, SRFBP1, ZCCHC9) meet the criteria for being uncharacterized, with ABT1 having the highest priority due to potential transcriptional links. Nine genes have established roles elsewhere but are flagged for potential novel roles; the kinase DYRK1A and helicase DDX18 are prioritized highest (priority 7) due to plausible molecular functions in regulating or executing steps in ribosome biogenesis. NOC4L (priority 6) is also notable, having a known 60S role but appearing in this 40S-centric cluster.                                                                            Small subunit (SSU) ribosome biogenesis and 18S rRNA maturation                                                                                                  Cluster 21 is dominated by factors involved in small ribosomal subunit (SSU) biogenesis, pre-18S rRNA processing, and assembly. The majority of genes (over 60%) have well-established roles in this pathway, supporting high confidence in pathway identity. Several additional translation initiation factors (EIF3/EIF4) and RNA helicases are present, reflecting close functional ties between ribosome biogenesis and the initiation of translation. Notably, some classic mRNA export and transport genes (RAN, RAE1) co-clustered, highlighting underexplored mechanistic intersections between ribosomal subunit export and canonical nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. One gene (RBIS) remains poorly characterized in terms of precise molecular role in humans, making it a strong candidate for novel discovery.         Ribosome biogenesis and processing of pre-rRNA                                                                         The gene cluster primarily consists of components involved in ribosome biogenesis and pre-rRNA processing, with strong representation from the small subunit (SSU) processome components. Established genes include major players in pre-18S rRNA processing steps. While most genes are characterized, NOC4L and NOL10 lack detailed functional studies. DDX18 and UTP14A present potential novel roles, connecting their established functions with the dominant ribosome biogenesis pathway. This pathway is strongly supported by a significant number of well-documented genes in ribosome assembly.                                         Ribosome biogenesis and 40S ribosomal subunit maturation                                                                                                                                                                                        Cluster 21 exhibits a highly coherent signature for ribosome biogenesis, specifically the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit and processing of pre-18S rRNA. The majority of the genes are well-established components of the SSU processome and translation initiation machinery. A subset of genes, although well characterized in other biological contexts such as transcription regulation, chromatin remodeling, kinase signaling, and metabolism, co-cluster with these ribosome biogenesis factors, hinting at possible novel roles in this pathway. Additionally, a few genes lack functional annotation and are high-priority candidates for follow-up studies to define their contributions to ribosome assembly.                                                        Small subunit (40S) ribosomal subunit biogenesis and translation initiation                                                                                      Cluster 21 is overwhelmingly composed of small‐subunit ribosome biogenesis factors (SSU processome and late 40S maturation) plus translation initiation components (eIF3/eIF4). This yields a high‐confidence assignment to 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis and the early steps of translation initiation. Three uncharacterized genes (RRP12, NOC4L, NOL10) stand out as gaps in the SSU processome. A set of transcriptional regulators and chromatin remodelers (ABT1, ESF1, DYRK1A, INO80, ZCCHC9) may play novel roles in Pol I transcription or nucleolar chromatin dynamics and merit follow-up.\n",
      "5      funk      37                mTOR/TORC1/TORC2 Signaling and Transcriptional Regulation                                                                                                                                                                                    This cluster represents a high-confidence mTOR signaling and transcriptional regulation network. Core mTORC1/mTORC2 complex members are prominently represented, with additional genes suggesting broader regulatory and trafficking connections. The cluster highlights the complex, multi-layered nature of mTOR signaling beyond canonical pathway components.                                         mTOR signaling pathway  Cluster 37 shows a strong enrichment for mTOR signaling pathway components, including the core kinase (MTOR) and essential components of both mTORC1 (RPTOR, MLST8, RHEB) and mTORC2 (RICTOR, MLST8) complexes. Also present are upstream regulators (PDPK1) and components of the GATOR2 complex (WDR24, SEH1L) that regulate mTOR in response to amino acids. The cluster reveals potential novel connections between mTOR signaling and membrane trafficking (TRAPPC and COG family proteins), suggesting that vesicular transport machinery may be coordinated with nutrient sensing. Particularly interesting is SLC4A7, which has recently been identified as providing bicarbonate for nucleotide synthesis downstream of mTORC1, representing a novel metabolic connection. The presence of SGF29 suggests potential epigenetic regulation linked to mTOR activity. Several integrator complex components (INTS9, INTS10, INTS11, INTS4, C7orf26) are also present, suggesting possible connections between mTOR signaling and transcriptional regulation.

No genes meet the strict criteria for being uncharacterized. The cluster integrates mTOR signaling with multiple downstream or related cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking (TRAPP, COG complexes), transcription and RNA processing (Integrator complex, SRSF3, HNRNPU, PTBP1, CDK13), protein folding (Prefoldin), metabolism (GARS1, SLC4A7), and cytoskeletal dynamics (MAP7D1, DYNLL1). Several genes involved in these associated processes, particularly the TRAPP and Integrator complexes, specific RNA processing factors, and the adapter protein DYNLL1, are prioritized (6-7) for investigation regarding potential novel roles in modulating or executing mTOR functions in this cellular context.                             mTOR signaling pathway (including mTORC1/2 complexes and their regulators, effectors, and upstream modulators)                                                                                                                                     Cluster 37 exhibits a high-confidence mTOR pathway signature, with many canonical mTORC1/mTORC2 complex members (MTOR, RPTOR, RICTOR, MLST8, RHEB, PDPK1), upstream regulators (SEH1L, WDR24), and new evidence of downstream metabolic effectors (SLC4A7). Several vesicle trafficking genes (TRAPPC8, TRAPPC11, TRAPPC3) are likely involved in membrane trafficking required for mTOR pathway function and may represent novel regulatory elements. One gene (MAP7D1) is currently poorly characterized and a strong candidate for discovery in this context. The cluster as a whole is highly cohesive for mTOR signaling but includes a set of trafficking and microtubule-associated proteins whose exact mechanistic integration into the pathway is either emerging or unknown.                                 mTOR signaling pathway                Cluster 37 predominantly features genes involved in the mTOR signaling pathway, a key regulator of cellular growth and metabolism. Several genes are well-established components of this pathway, including MTOR, RICTOR, RPTOR, and MLST8, which are core members of the mTOR complexes. Novel roles are suggested for SLC4A7, TRAPPC8, and COG3, which may provide new insights into the extracellular or intercompartmental regulation of mTOR signaling. The high confidence in this pathway designation is due to the presence of multiple established pathway components that collectively elucidate a central role in cell growth and autophagy regulation.        mTOR signaling pathway (integration of mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulation and nutrient sensing)  Cluster 37 is dominated by key mTOR signaling components including PDPK1, RICTOR, RPTOR, MLST8, RHEB, MTOR, SEH1L, WDR24, and SLC4A7—genes with well-documented roles in the assembly, activation, and function of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. This strong mTOR signature provides high confidence that the cluster’s dominant biological process is mTOR-mediated nutrient sensing and anabolic regulation. The remaining genes, although well characterized in other contexts (e.g., RNA splicing, vesicular trafficking, chromatin regulation), have not been classically linked to mTOR signaling. Their co-clustering suggests they may play novel or modulatory roles in integrating mTOR-driven signals with processes such as RNA processing, protein folding, and intracellular trafficking. These candidates merit focused follow-up studies to elucidate any additional regulatory connections to mTOR.                                                                                mTORC1/2 nutrient- and growth-factor signaling axis  Cluster 37 is dominated by high‐confidence mTOR signaling components spanning both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (MTOR, RPTOR, RICTOR, MLST8, RHEB, PDPK1) and key nutrient sensors (WDR24, SEH1L, SLC4A7). Two genes (ERH, MAP7D1) are virtually unstudied outside of a few reports and merit top priority for uncovering novel mTOR links. A set of vesicle-trafficking and motor proteins (DYNLL1, TRAPPC8, TRAPPC11, COG2/3/4) and the PKA regulator PRKAR1A score as mid‐priority candidates for modulating mTORC1 lysosomal recruitment or cross‐talk. The remainder are well characterized in other processes but lack strong evidence for a direct role in mTOR signaling and are deprioritized.\n",

The majority of genes are involved in tRNA maturation, pre-rRNA processing, and RNA modification, suggesting a tightly coordinated molecular machinery for RNA metabolism.                     tRNA processing via ribonuclease P complex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This cluster shows a strong signature of tRNA processing via the ribonuclease P (RNase P) complex, with 9 established components of this complex present (RPP30, POP1, POP7, RPP14, RPP40, RPP38, POP5, POP4, and the putative component RPP25L). Interestingly, the cluster also contains two components of the EKC/KEOPS complex (OSGEP and GON7) that are involved in a different aspect of tRNA modification, suggesting a potential functional link between these two tRNA processing pathways.

The cluster thus represents nuclear tRNA processing and modification as the dominant pathway with high confidence. C18orf21 is uncharacterized and merits high-priority investigation for potential roles in this pathway. RNASEH1 and MAGED2, both characterized in other biological contexts, are strong candidates for novel or previously unrecognized roles in nuclear tRNA biogenesis based on the phenotypic clustering.                    Ribonuclease P/MRP complex activity  Cluster C5255 reveals a dominant involvement in the ribonuclease P/MRP complex activity, with several established components of this pathway represented in the gene cluster. C18orf21 remains uncharacterized and may provide insights into unappreciated functions within the ribonuclease landscape. Novel roles are suggested for OSGEP and GON7, known for RNA modification, raising interest in their ribonuclease activity connection, while MAGED2 presents an outlier with its distinct established role yet plausible RNA regulatory function. Further analysis of RNASEH1 and RPP25L may consolidate understanding of these genes' links to the ribonuclease complex.                                                 tRNA maturation via RNase P and t6A modification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Cluster C5255 is dominated by genes that are core components of the RNase P complex and the KEOPS complex, which are critical for tRNA 5'-end cleavage and t6A modification, respectively. This strong representation of tRNA maturation machinery underpins a high confidence assignment of the dominant process. Additionally, RNASEH1 and MAGED2, despite established roles in other pathways, emerge as novel candidates for a potential unrecognized contribution to tRNA processing. C18orf21 remains uncharacterized and merits investigation as a possible new player in this essential RNA processing pathway.

Two poorly characterized genes (C18orf21, RPP25L) emerge as top candidates for novel RNase P/MRP components.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This cluster shows a highly coherent signature of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The core components include the entire AP-2 adaptor complex (AP2A1, AP2A2, AP2B1, AP2M1, AP2S1), which is essential for cargo selection and clathrin coat assembly, along with established CME regulators PICALM and FCHO2. C15orf57 has recently been identified as a regulator of CME but remains incompletely characterized. AAGAB and AGFG1 have established roles in other vesicular trafficking processes but their specific functions in CME warrant further investigation. This cluster represents a comprehensive collection of proteins involved in the early stages of endocytic vesicle formation.                                                             Clathrin-mediated endocytosis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Cluster 2067 is highly enriched for genes involved in Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME). Eight genes (AP2A1, AP2A2, AP2B1, AP2M1, AP2S1, PICALM, FCHO2, C15orf57) are well-established components or regulators of the AP-2 complex and clathrin-coated vesicle formation. Two genes, AAGAB (involved in endocytic recycling) and AGFG1 (involved in vesicle fusion, RNA trafficking, HIV), have established roles in other processes but cluster with CME genes, suggesting potential novel roles within the CME pathway itself. AGFG1 represents a higher priority for investigation due to its less obvious connection to endocytosis compared to AAGAB.

All but two genes (AAGAB, AGFG1) have well-documented roles in CME. AAGAB and AGFG1, although characterized in membrane trafficking or related processes, have not been firmly integrated into the canonical CME pathway and so represent candidates for discovering new mechanistic links. No genes in this cluster conform to the strict criteria for being truly uncharacterized; all have at least moderate published functional evidence. This cluster strongly implicates AP-2-mediated vesicle assembly as the phenotypic driver of the observed OPS pattern.                          Clathrin-mediated endocytosis                                                                         The cluster is characterized by genes involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, providing high-confidence identification of this pathway as dominant. The AP2 complex members (AP2A1, AP2A2, AP2B1, AP2M1, AP2S1) and PICALM are well-established components of the pathway. FCHO2 also functions prominently as an early component in pit formation. Potential novel roles include AAGAB, which may further elucidate its participation in endocytic processes, and C15orf57's connection to this pathway. AGFG1 presents a potential cross-pathway link warranting exploration for novel interactions.

AGFG1, though established in other vesicular trafficking contexts, emerges as a candidate for a novel role in CME, warranting further investigation.

AGFG1 and AAGAB emerge as promising candidates for novel roles in AP-2–dependent endocytosis and warrant follow-up.\n",
      "9  wainberg    2213                                     Ether Lipid/Plasmalogen Biosynthesis  This cluster represents a highly coherent group of genes involved in ether lipid and plasmalogen biosynthesis. Multiple genes catalyze critical steps in the pathway, including fatty alcohol production (FAR1), initial acyl transfer (GNPAT, AGPS), ethanolamine phospholipid synthesis (EPT1, PCYT2), and plasmalogen desaturation (TMEM189). The cluster reveals a comprehensive view of the enzymatic steps required for ether lipid production, with potential novel roles for SEC14L1 and PEX7 in pathway regulation or protein trafficking.                   Ether lipid/plasmalogen biosynthesis pathway                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This cluster shows a strong signature of the ether lipid/plasmalogen biosynthesis pathway, with 5 established genes (AGPS, FAR1, GNPAT, TMEM189, PEX7) directly involved in different steps of this process. AGPS and GNPAT catalyze the initial steps of ether lipid synthesis, FAR1 produces fatty alcohols essential for this pathway, TMEM189 functions as a plasmanylethanolamine desaturase, and PEX7 is required for peroxisomal import of enzymes like AGPS. The cluster also contains genes involved in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis (EPT1, PCYT2) that may have additional roles in plasmalogen production, and SEC14L1, which may represent a novel connection to ether lipid transport or regulation. This clustering suggests functional coordination between conventional and ether phospholipid metabolism.                                     Ether lipid and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Cluster 2213 is highly enriched for genes involved in the biosynthesis of ether lipids (plasmalogens) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). This includes key enzymes in the pathway (GNPAT, AGPS, FAR1, TMEM189, EPT1, PCYT2) and a gene required for peroxisomal import of pathway enzymes (PEX7). These genes represent different steps and cellular compartments involved in this lipid synthesis pathway, supporting a high-confidence assignment. SEC14L1, with known roles in innate immunity and cholinergic transport, is the only gene not directly linked to this pathway, suggesting a potential novel role in lipid metabolism or a related process.                                             Ether lipid and Plasmalogen Biosynthesis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Cluster 2213 exhibits high confidence for the Ether lipid and Plasmalogen Biosynthesis pathway. Seven genes (AGPS, EPT1, FAR1, GNPAT, PCYT2, PEX7, TMEM189) are established components involved in peroxisomal and ER steps, substrate provision (fatty alcohols), precursor synthesis (CDP-ethanolamine), or peroxisomal import machinery essential for the pathway. SEC14L1, a lipid-binding protein with other known functions, is flagged as potentially having a novel role in this pathway (Priority 7), meriting investigation due to its co-clustering and potential lipid transport/regulatory function within this specific metabolic context.                                                                                      Ether lipid (plasmalogen) biosynthesis and remodeling                                                                    Cluster 2213 is dominated by genes with established, literature-supported roles in ether lipid biosynthesis, particularly the plasmalogen branch. Five genes (AGPS, FAR1, GNPAT, PEX7, TMEM189) are canonical components of this pathway, covering biosynthetic and peroxisomal transport processes. EPT1 and PCYT2, while involved in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis, participate in the Kennedy pathway and also intersect with plasmalogen synthesis as EPT1 can catalyze synthesis of plasmanyl-PE. SEC14L1 stands out as a strong candidate for a novel connection, given its lipid-related domains and established roles in unrelated signaling and transport processes. There are no truly uncharacterized genes in this cluster. The presence of multiple core ether lipid genes leads to high confidence in the pathway assignment.               Ether lipid and plasmalogen biosynthesis                  This analysis identifies the ether lipid and plasmalogen biosynthesis pathway as the dominant biological process for cluster 2213. AGPS, FAR1, GNPAT, and TMEM189 are established members of this pathway with clear involvement in the synthesis steps. EPT1, PCYT2, and PEX7 are identified as genes with potential novel roles, suggesting they could contribute to ether lipid biosynthesis in ways not fully characterized. SEC14L1 presents a possible novel connection due to its lipid-binding properties, albeit with weaker evidence. Overall, this cluster shows a strong, coherent pathway with several promising avenues for further investigation.                                                             Ether Lipid/Plasmalogen Biosynthesis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Cluster 2213 shows a strong, high-confidence signature for the plasmalogen/ether lipid biosynthesis pathway. Seven genes (AGPS, EPT1, FAR1, GNPAT, PCYT2, PEX7, and TMEM189) are canonical members involved in distinct steps of this pathway from early substrate activation to final desaturation. The outlier, SEC14L1, is traditionally linked to innate immunity, suggesting a potential novel role at the intersection of immune signaling and lipid metabolism, which merits additional follow-up.                                                                              Peroxisomal–ER plasmalogen (ether lipid) biosynthesis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Cluster 2213 is driven by the stepwise biosynthesis of plasmalogens: peroxisomal import (PEX7), acyl‐DHAP and alkyl‐DHAP formation (GNPAT, AGPS), fatty alcohol production (FAR1), ER desaturation (TMEM189), and CDP-ethanolamine–dependent headgroup assembly (PCYT2, EPT1). SEC14L1 stands out as a potential novel regulator of plasmalogen distribution.\n",
