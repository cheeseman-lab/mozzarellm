I have a set of genes and need your expertise to analyze their shared biological function or pathway.

Genes: {gene_list}

Please follow these specific steps in your analysis:
1. Carefully examine the gene set to identify patterns or functional relationships
2. Consider known biological pathways, processes, and functions that might connect these genes
3. Determine the most likely shared biological function or pathway

Your response MUST follow this exact format:
FUNCTION NAME: [Provide a concise, specific name for the biological function/pathway]
CONFIDENCE SCORE: [A numerical score between 0.0-1.0 that reflects your certainty]
ANALYSIS: [Detailed explanation of your reasoning, including:
- Key genes driving your conclusion
- Supporting evidence for the functional relationship
- Alternative interpretations you considered
- Limitations or uncertainties in your assessment]

Aim for precision and specificity in your function naming. Avoid overly broad terms like "cancer-related genes" unless truly appropriate.
